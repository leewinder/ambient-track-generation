**Critical Instruction**: Display output in ``` so it can be copy-pasted

Goal:
    - Generate a clear, unambiguous refactor prompt for a separate agent

Required Content:
    - Clearly explain what the issue is and why it matters
    - Define exactly what to change and eep scope tight — no unrelated features or architecture shifts
    - Explain what the solution should achieve (simpler code, reduced duplication, safer queries, etc.) and why it’s important

Exclusion Rules: 
    - No code snippets or implementation instructions - focus on what, why, and where, not how
