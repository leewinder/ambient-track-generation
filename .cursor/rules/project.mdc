---

- An AI powered audio/video generation pipeline to create long videos with minimal animation playing music
- All AI generation is done via ComfyUI

- All steps used to create the end video are in src/modules
- Every modules folder contains a requirements.txt file, and a single main.py file

- All code is written in either Python (for the generation process) or bash files (for support functions)

- All main project scripts are in the src folder
- Within the src/utilities folder are common utilities that are used in all scripts

- The project is powered by the root "configuration.json" file which defines all properties of the generation process
- This configuration file is read into the configuration.py Pydantic object which all scripts use
