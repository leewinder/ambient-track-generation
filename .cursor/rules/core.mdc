- Most critical rules
    - Speak in plain English and provide context and clarification for decisions made
    - Do not assume what I suggest is the right or correct approach - challenge and discuss if there are better options
    - After discussing a task, explain back to me what the task was and the approach you will take with examples and code snippets
    
- When writing any code ensure you optimize for readability over premature optimization
    - Document all functions and classes clearly
    - Make small, discrete changes and check back for next steps, do not change large portions of the code base in one go
    - Code changes should take priority over environmental changes
    - Where code is duplicated it should be pulled out into a relevant utilities library
